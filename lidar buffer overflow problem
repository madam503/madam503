##if you watched 'buffer overflow detected' on jetson nano + rplidar combo, try this code at cmd.

~/catkin_ws> catkin_make rplidarNode

~/catkin_ws> source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

~/catkin_ws> roslaunch rplidar_ros view_rplidar.launch

##if your rviz can't print the lidar image yet, enter the following command additionally.

~/catkin_ws> sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0

~/catkin_ws> source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

~/catkin_ws> roslaunch rplidar_ros view_rplidar.launch

##Good luck!
